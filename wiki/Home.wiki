_Now Supports Twitter Pics!!!_

= What is !SharePoint Twitter? =
 

Are you looking to show the twitter updates of your organization on your sharepoint portal ? If yes, then this project is what you might need.

We are providing two webparts for !SharePoint 2007 & !SharePoint 2010, one that can be used to show the tweets of any user on the !SharePoint portal. Second webpart can be used to post tweet to twitter directly from your sharepoint portal. Just download and install, and you are all set. 

All you need is to configure the twitter settings after installation. 

These web parts use out of the box !SharePoint CSS elements that match automatically with your current site theme.
